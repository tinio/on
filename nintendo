First, in order to convey my sentiment towards the company, making the pilgramage to Kyoto H.Q. has long been a life goal. One that I've accomplished. So yeah, I speak as a fan. And with that, having bought a Wii U today, I hope I am wrong when I say, that I believe this release will be Nintendo's last hurrah. Let me explain...

Falling way short of high bar and expectations set by itself in the past. Inability to provide plug and play gaming experience. Losing focus on what they are good at. Proposed move is to embrace the web platform. Google + Nintendo, Play + Wii?

Humility.
