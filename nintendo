First, in order to convey my sentiment towards the company, making the pilgramage to Kyoto H.Q. has long been a life goal. One that I accomplished last December. So yeah, I speak as an avid non-fanatic fan. And with that, having bought a Wii U today, I hope I am wrong when I say that I believe this release will be Nintendo's last hurrah. Let me explain...

Falling way short of high bar and expectations set by itself in the past. Inability to provide plug and play gaming experience. Losing focus on what they are good at. Over reliance on the crown jewels of established characters.

Possible courses of action. Ask for help. Many developers owe a lot to them. Embrace the web platform. Partnerships. Google + Nintendo, Play + Wii?

Show humility. Be humble.
