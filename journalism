As a part of a generation that has largely abandoned print newspapers and magazines, imagining the future of journalism has been a daunting task. Still, it seems reasonable to conclude journalism will endure. Without good content, the growing list of aggregators will become useless, after all.

I joined this organization believing a programmer can have a role in contributing to a new model for news that not only endures, but thrives. I'm interested in building a site that scales, mining the widening web of structured data and examining other distribution platforms.

There's no shortage of problems and issues to delve into, as we all know. But I see them as opportunities to make a meaningful dent in the universe.
